# Simulation on DDoS Attack – MSc Final Year Project

This repository contains the code and documentation for my final year MSc project titled **"Simulation on DDoS Attack"**.

## 👩‍💻 Author:
**Sonam**  
MSc Computer Science – Final Year

## 🧪 Project Overview:
This project focuses on simulating different types of Distributed Denial-of-Service (DDoS) attacks to understand their behavior and effects on target systems. The simulation uses real-world tools and Python scripts to generate attack traffic and analyze results.

## 🛠️ Tools & Technologies Used:
- **Programming Language:** Python
- **Attack Tools:**
  - `hping3` – for TCP/UDP flood attacks
  - `Slowloris` – for slow HTTP header DDoS
  - `GoldenEye` – for HTTP-based DDoS

## 📁 Project Structure:
- `scripts/` – Python scripts to automate or support attack simulations
- `logs/` – Output logs from attack tools
- `report/` – Final project documentation and screenshots

## 🚀 How to Run:
1. Install required tools:
   `git clone https://github.com/sonamproject-2025/DDoS-Attack.git`
   `ls` >> `cd DDoS-Attack`
  `sudo apt install hping3`
   
3. Run simulations using provided scripts in the `scripts/` folder.  
   Example:  
   `python3 simulate_attack.py`

## ⚠️ Disclaimer:
This project is intended for educational and academic purposes **only**. Do not use these tools on unauthorized systems.
